# Elastic

This repository contains Ruby integrations for [Elastic](http://elastic.org):

* a client for connecting to an Elastic cluster,
* a Ruby API for the Elastic's REST API,
* various extensions and utilities.

For integration with Ruby models and Rails applications,
see the <https://github.com/elastic/skytap_elastic-rails> project.

## Compatibility

The libraries are compatible with Ruby 1.8.7 and higher.

The library is compatible with Elastic 0.90, 1.x and 2.x -- you have to install and use a matching version, though.

The 1.x versions and the master branch are compatible with Elastic 1.x and 2.x APIs.

To use the **Elastic 0.90** API, install the **0.4.x** gem version or use the corresponding
[`0.4`](https://github.com/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby/tree/0.4) branch.

## Installation

Install the `elastic` package from [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/elastic):

    gem install elastic

To use an unreleased version, either add it to your `Gemfile` for [Bundler](http://gembundler.com):

    gem 'elastic', git: 'git://github.com/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby.git'

or install it from a source code checkout:

    git clone https://github.com/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby.git
    cd skytap_elastic-ruby/elastic
    bundle install
    rake install

## Usage

The [`elastic`](https://github.com/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby/tree/master/elastic)
library is a wrapper for two separate libraries:

* [`skytap_elastic-transport`](https://github.com/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby/tree/master/skytap_elastic-transport),
  which provides a low-level Ruby client for connecting to an [Elastic](http://elastic.org) cluster
* [`skytap_elastic-api`](https://github.com/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby/tree/master/skytap_elastic-api),
  which provides a Ruby API for the Elastic RESTful API

```ruby
require 'skytap_elastic'

client = SkytapElastic::Client.new log: true

client.transport.reload_connections!

client.cluster.health

client.search q: 'test'

# etc.
```

Both of these libraries are extensively documented.
**Please read the [`skytap_elastic-transport`](http://rubydoc.info/gems/skytap_elastic-transport)
and the [`skytap_elastic-api`](http://rubydoc.info/gems/skytap_elastic-api) documentation carefully.**

_Keep in mind, that for optimal performance, you should use a HTTP library which supports persistent
("keep-alive") connections, e.g. [Patron](https://github.com/toland/patron) or
[Typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus)._

This repository contains these additional Ruby libraries:

* [`skytap_elastic-extensions`](https://github.com/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby/tree/master/skytap_elastic-extensions),
   which provides a set of extensions to the base library,
* [`skytap_elastic-dsl`](https://github.com/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby/tree/master/skytap_elastic-dsl),
  which provides a Ruby API for the [Elastic Query DSL](http://www.elastic.org/guide/en/elastic/reference/current/query-dsl.html),
* [`skytap_elastic-watcher`](https://github.com/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby/tree/master/skytap_elastic-watcher),
  which provides Ruby API for the [_Watcher_](https://www.elastic.co/products/watcher) plugin.

Please see their respective READMEs for information and documentation.

## Development

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby)

To work on the code, clone and bootstrap the project first:

```
git clone https://github.com/elastic/skytap_elastic-ruby.git
cd skytap_elastic-ruby/
rake setup
rake bundle
```

This will clone the Elastic repository into the project, and run `bundle install` in all subprojects.

To run tests, you need to start a testing cluster on port 9250,
or provide a different one in the `TEST_CLUSTER_PORT` environment variable.

There's a Rake task to start the testing cluster:

```
rake test:cluster:start
```

You can configure the port, path to the startup script,
number of nodes, and other settings with environment variables:

```
TEST_CLUSTER_COMMAND=./tmp/builds/skytap_elastic-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/elastic \
TEST_CLUSTER_PORT=9250 \
TEST_CLUSTER_NODES=2 \
TEST_CLUSTER_NAME=my_cluster \
TEST_CLUSTER_PARAMS='-Xms500m -Xmx500m -D es.index.store.type=niofs' \
TEST_CLUSTER_TIMEOUT=120 \
rake test:cluster:start
```

To run tests against unreleased Elastic versions, you can use the `rake elastic:build`
Rake task to build Elastic from the cloned source
(use `rake elastic:update` to update the repository):

**Note:** If you have gems from the `elastic` family installed system-wide,
          and want to use development ones, prepend the command with `bundle exec`.

```
rake elastic:build
```

You can pass a branch name (tag, commit, ...) as the Rake task variable:

```
rake elastic:build[origin/1.x]
```

To run all the tests in all the subprojects, use the Rake task:

```
time rake test:all
```
